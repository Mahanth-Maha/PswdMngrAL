## About

Its hard to remember things, that too diiferent passwords for different sites... Nah, so most of us use one password for all sites which is vunerable, so use this Password Manager to keep diiferent passwords for different sites without being explicitly remebering all passwords, which can also auto login to the website.

This Software works fine in Windows OS ,but it Can run in Mac OS and Linux without AutoFill feauture, It bascially stores mail and Password with encryption. When User needs to login into with his credentials he just need to open software and unlock it then the software it self takes the mail and password , opens a browser tab and autofills the credentials and login into site automatically.

## MASTER PASSWORD

The Master Password is one and only password you should remember , everything else is softwares work , so chose it stronger including atleast 1 special charecter , 1 numerical , 1 Capital and in total of minimum length of 8. Offcurse its hard to remember that too, so use a phrase , a really long one like "ineedgunslotsofguns" or "maybeishouldhavedoneit".
